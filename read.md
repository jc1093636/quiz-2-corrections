# Quiz 2 Corrections
1. Write the following mathematical expressions in Java. Assume variables `a`,
2. `b`, and `c` have been declared and initialized.
```
ANSWER:
(-b + Math.sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)

This is the answer because it separates both the top and the bottom parts of
the math expression in parentheses for Java to properly read and solve the
expression. The Java expression also calls the Math.sqrt() method to take the
square root on one portion of the top part of the quadratic formula.

8. What output is generated by the following code segment?
```
where
here
why?

This is the answer because the first if statement is true. As a result the
program prints out "where?" and skips to the next line if x is less than 10
and 5 is greater than or equal to y. The program then executes the nested
if-statement after the first println statement due to the initial if-statement
being true. Then the program prints out "here" and skips to the next line
because the if-statement's conditions of if y is less than 0 or is y is
equal to 3 evaluates to true. The program then bypasses the else-statement
as the earlier initial if-statement evaluated to true, and then prints out
"why?" and skips to the next line and finally the program ends.
```
11. What output is generated by the following code segment?
```
Incorrect
Incorrect
Invalid choice!

This is the answer because the program starts at case b, but its switch
statements do not contain break lines. As a result, it continues to go
through the rest of the switch statements, executing three println
statements to display the answer above.
```
12. Write a boolean expression that is true if the first character in the string variable str is a upper-case alphabetic character. Assume str has been declared and initialized. Hint:  Use the charAt method.
```
'A' <= str.charAt(0) && str.charAt(0) <= 'Z'
```
13. Write an if-else statement that displays "___ is even" if the value of the `int` variable num is even, otherwise display "___ is odd" (the blank must be the value of `num`). Assume num has been declared and initialized.
```java
if (num % 2 == 0) {
   System.out.println(num + " is even");
} else {
   System.out.println("num + "is odd");
}

This is the answer because an even number divided by 2 would have a
remainder of 2 and if otherwise would be an odd number. So the if
condition would be if the remainder of `num` is equal to 0, then num
is an even number. If not then the program would print out that its an odd number.
